The database is designed to support the carthographic parts for a PUG, which is essential for urban planning and development. It consists of several key tables: "uat" that represents the administrative domain for the city, "intravilan" for the constructed area, "drumuri" this table records road information, "cartier" this table describes neighborhoods within built-up areas, "cvartale" it details blocks within neighborhoods, "puncte_interes" this table holds points of interest within built-up areas, "zonificare_functionala" it outlines functional zoning areas, "reglementari" it specifies regulatory details for changes in the general functional zoning. Every "uat" has one or more "intravilan" polygons, any road ("drumuri") can pass through one or more "intravilan" and every "intravilan" can have one or many roads ("drumuri"). For every "intravilan" there are one ore more neighbourhoods ("cartier") and points of interests ("puncte_de_interes"). For every neighbourhood there can be more blocks ("cvartale"). "Zonificarea_functionala" and "intravilan" have a relationshis many to many, as in every class of functional zooning can be found in more than one "intravilan" and every intravilan has more zooning classes. Any "zonificare_functionala" can have only one area of reglementations ("reglementari")
